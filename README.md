# PlantTweet
So you've always wanted to timelapse a plant growing from a seed, right? And you're keen on the wisdom of Chinese poverbs, yes? Well, here at Think Physics we've solved your problem! You can follow our plant on Twitter @think_plant for regular photo updates and proverbs.

##How does it work?
### What does this program do?
Step 1. Check the time.
Step 2. On the hours betteen 8am and 6pm (office hours of course) take a photo using the Raspberry Pi Camera
Step 3. Post this photo and a random proverb to the @think_plant twitter account
Step 4. Upload the image to DropBox - for a timelapse project later
Step 5. Delete photo from the Raspberry Pi

###Where do we start? Our dependancies.
You'll need to get a DropBox upload programme running on your Pi. This uploader worked perfectly for me - https://github.com/andreafabrizi/Dropbox-Uploader - follow the instructions carefully!
